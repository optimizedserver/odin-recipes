This is just an brief introduction
I am still learning and feeling good about it. Its 11:33 of a Saturday night
Hope this journey will be a great one.

This project will contain recipies and links maybe to different website and let's see how it will go.
It's kind of still a mystery to me.

I am assuming that it will test my simple html skills such as how to paragraph, lists, put images and links.

I really want to thank the people of "The Odin Project" 
They are the best.
